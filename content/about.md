Hello, my name is Tarek Bouali

I was born in Tanger (Morocco), in 1995, and since I was 5 years old I have lived in Spain. I am a senior technician in multi-platform application development and I'm studying computer engineering right now. I have been a GNU / Linux user for more than 10 years, so I have a very close relationship with free software. I love computer security also  and since 3 years I have been participating in lots of bug bounty programs on a casual basis. I have found security flaws in large companies such as Microsoft, Firefox, Adobe, etc, obtaining multiple public acknowledgments. 

I consider myself a self-taught person, who loves to learn new things. I'm passionate about reading and I'm always open to exploring new knowledge. I like to collaborate on projects also and to help when I'm needed, always ready to contribute my grain of sand. I love to work in exciting and challenging new projects. From a very young age, I have developed multiple projects and over the years the experience gained through various ventures has allowed me to quickly understand the "big picture" of an idea, understand the requirements and turn them into technical solutions.

As an independent software developer and consultant, I'm glad to receive any request. Feel free to contact me by [E-Mail](mailto:me@bouali.io).
